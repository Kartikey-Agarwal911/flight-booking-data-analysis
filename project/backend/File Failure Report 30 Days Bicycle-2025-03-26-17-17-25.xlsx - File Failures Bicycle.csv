Unfortunately the zip file that we are receiving is encrypted and the system fails to decrypt it using the key most probably because it is corrupted/invalid. Because of this we're limited to see anything else in detail inside the file.

Good Morning,

File 'InvoiceData20250326_0347.xml' is failing because the XML data being processed has an element <ROUTING> which is expected to appear at most once (with optionality set zero or 1), but it looks like it is occurring multiple times in the XML structure on lines 13-25 and 355-368. You can refer to the attached screenshot.

Kindly revise and resubmit files for further processing.

Hello Team, 

There were (3) Open Balance batches processing that were locked up due to them containing invalid/corrupt files. See screenshot from 1 of the jobs. I have deleted the locked-up batches and removed many more files on the ftp that would have eventually failed. Screenshot also attached.
Please revise and resubmit a valid OB file.

Good Morning,

BatchId: 30484557 is stalled due to account 6914102 which is currently configured with ""Discount Date"" as the autopay timing option.
I have escalated this for review to see if your data allows for this particular setting.
I will update the case when more detailed information is available.

Good Morning,

BatchId: 30484557 is stalled due to account 666331 which is currently configured with ""Discount Date"" as the autopay timing option.
Since your processing is not set to capture DUE_DATE or DISCOUNT_DATE, it is causing the batch to fail.
The easiest way to complete the batch would be for us to manually add a Due Date for Invoice PC250374255. Normally, I would just set the DueDate to the next business day (3/20/2035). Please let me know if that is OK or if you prefer that I set another date.

Going forward, we will limit the ability to select an option that is not capture during your processing.

In this batch, none of the documents have either a due date or a discount date. If we allow the buyer to select timing options like Due or Discount yet those properties are not captured, biscuit will fail. Looking at the customers parser and script, we do not have any mapping or logic to capture DUE_DATE or DISCOUNT_DATE. Therefore, those timings should not be allowed as they will always cause failures when selected as the auto pay timing date. Those options should be removed from CSR under the EIC/OBP/SSO tab, setting is ""Autopay Timing Options""."

As a result, the empty main batch is more than likely the cause of the empty batch failure. 

To address it, looks like we need to flip the value in the 7th parameter of the btObj.CreateInsertBatchMulti() function being called from PostBatch from ""False"" to ""True"".
That will control the closing out of the empty batch which should prevent the empty batch message from being thrown."

The file 'az_bfwd_stmt_022825.dat' failed to process because of a data issue. On lines 215758 and 215760 there are line break characters that are causing the lines to break and because of this our parser is failing to process the data correctly. See attached screenshot for reference.

Hello,

I believe I understand the issue.

We have our SFTP connection setup under BMC user not BLDR user.

Can you assist me in transferring that file to the BLDR account and helping me setup the BLDR SFTP?

Hello,

We completed a change last night to convert from FTP to SFTP.

We have encountered issues we are trying to correct.

We attempted to upload the file created by the system.

Can you advise us as to what you normally see when our files are automatically processed.

The below is the information we have.

The file uploaded must be a zipped file.

Can you explain the naming convention?

Can you also show us the files that you received when they are unzipped?

Hello Sheryl,

I see a couple problems here. Your files are normally in .zip format such as: 'stockbuildingsupply_inv_030620250330.zip'.
The included file should meet the following file name syntax:
Invoice: %inv%, %mlid%
Statement: %stm%, %mlsd%

Also, the format is completely different than what we normally process. I have attached screenshots showing the file structure and content for both good and failed files.
Please let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,"

Hello,

I must have sent this email after you replied.

We have several accounts with BillTrust.

We uploaded a file for BLDR under the BMC SFTP Account.

Can you assist me in setting up the other account BLDR on a SFTP?

Can you also forward the file that goes to BLDR not BMC to the appropriate account?

The two accounts have different ERP system and the files, and their format are different.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

I was able to reprocess file 'bldr_inv_030725' successfully under new batch 30413087 for BLDR, Builders FirstSource (2700).

Good Afternoon,

Thank you, William.

I have been on the phone with BillTrust support for an hour trying to get the SFTP setup for BLDR.

I was able to successfully upload the file for BMC.

Again, thank you for moving the file for us.

Hi Sheryl,

Looping in our CS team. If this is in regards to the SFTP changes they will be able to assist further. I see William helped with the file issue on this case. Are the two of these related? Please advise or is this something separate. I know we had another thread regarding the SFTP migration but wanted to make sure we are all aligned for this.

Thank you,

Afternoon,

We need assistance please.

Is there a way we can send a sftp test file for our bldr and then our bmc units?

Our developers believe they have corrected the problems with the bldr unit but we need to test.

Can someone assist us please?

Hello Team, 

Batch ID: 30387033 failed due to invalid formatting in file 'camp invoices 03032025.pdf'.
The last 2 pages of the file, containing terms are causing the file to fail. Please revise and resubmit for processing.

As expected, the Terms Page was the issue - it looks like the test batch you ran with the pages removed had some issues with the PDF creation (page 1 is mostly blank, subsequent pages have black boxes in place of text). I created my own version of the PDF with the terms pages removed using Ghostscript and the batch successfully ran in 27630246.

Because we're parsing the PDF directly by scraping text off of the pages, it's imperative that the customer only sends invoices without extra attachments, and sticks to a consistent format. Going forward, customer should remove terms pages/extra non-invoice pages from the export that they send to us. For this instance, we can likely use my copy of the PDF to run in production, so I've added it to the pcase SAMPLE_DATA folder."

Hello,

Batch ID: 30506427
File ""CTESERVIV250321.TXT"" failed due to having invalid literal for float(): 5082.55- at line number 3977.
The value 5082.55-T(line 3977) passed in the data file is getting captured as a tax record through our logic. Since the value is going through the script as 5082.55- it is failing as an invalid value. Changing the value to -5082.55 would allow the file to process. I have attached screenshot.
Please revise and resubmit for processing.

Why would the job process the csv file if it was known the zip file had a
problem?

I got a message asking me to resubmit the zip file, which I did.  There is
nothing else I can do as far as I know.

The zip file has the signature images that were supposed to be on the

The current configuration does not prevent a csv invoicing file from processing without a signature file.
We can look to alter the rules going forward.

Thanks, that would seem to make sense.  We always send two files, so if
either one is bad, it would be great if you could either delete or
quarantine both, if one has a problem, and ask us to resubmit both.  Or,
hold the good file until we successfully submit the second.

Not sure how much work that would be, but would be nice.

I changed the rule to initiate processing to now look for 2 files. Since you always process 2, this an easy way to prevent just 1 file from running.

Batch Id: 30423025 failed with error ""There is no matching branch number, 5000, in the T8 lookup table for logo logic"" for the files 'ced_4162_inv_031025055708.txt' and 'ced_3020_inv_031025055856.txt'. 
After further checking we don't see any lookup file present over FTP which is the reason for this failure. Please update the lookup file and resend the data files 'ced_4162_inv_031025055708.txt' and 'ced_3020_inv_031025055856.txt' for processing.

 Good Morning, 
 
We have several failures from over the weekend due to missing T8 Lookup file. I also see the T5 file is missing as well. Please provide an updated copy of the file so we can reprocess the failed batches.

Hello Patrick,

Batch ID:  04031502 (https://billtrust.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/500PI00000OU9PqYAL/view) ,  04031518 (https://billtrust.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/500PI00000OUCMAYA5/view) ,  04031527 (https://billtrust.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/500PI00000OUFrrYAH/view) , and 04031564 failed because at the time that the batch tried to attach documents, the batch which contained those attachment pdfs did not complete processing. This caused the files to fail. Once the batch that contained those attachment pdfs completed we were able to restage the files for processing.

The filerule script uses some shared resources from a BTFuncs script which has some other changes in flight being run and tested in imstage. 

The updated CED filerule script was calling a couple of those resources and was failing the script in a way which allowed the empty CED_POD batches to be launched. 

I've updated the script to not use those references for now, so we should be good going forward.

Hi Julian,

The inclusion of BTRetry in the file name indicates that your teams/processes submitted that data to the GMC process. Please advise on whether we need to resubmit the original files or if your side is able to handle the process.


Thank You,

As checked I don't see folder with failed job id in GMC or FTProot. But can see few files along with BTI_END.xml in FTProot .Seems like those were the files which failed.

Hello,
Unfortunately your file has failed to process today. This failure was caused by the file: 'igopenbal_min_20250322_03355146.csv' that was received by us is empty.
So we removed that empty file and restaged valid file 'igopenbal_min_20250323_03370494.csv' for processing but as per the OB files rule two or more then two OB files required to process further .
Hence, this 'igopenbal_min_20250323_03370494.csv' file will process automatically Once you upload the new OB file to FTP. 

If this 'igopenbal_min_20250322_03355146.csv' file was meant to contain valid data for processing, please revise and resubmit. If not, no further action is required from you and we will resume standard processing when you upload your next file.

Not clear from the error below exactly what this issue is.  The note tag appears to be properly formed with a closing </Note>. Is the issue that the note spans more than one line?"

Chris,

Correct, when the the note tag is spanning on multiple lines, it is causing issues with our parser and ultimately failing to process the file. Correcting this will resolve the issue.

As checked, it looks like the file failed since it contains no DOCUMENT tag as per the error log but when I compare the latest processed file <StatementLine> tag is missing . I am not 100% sure about the failure cause .(In TEST its failing)

Good Afternoon,

Unfortunately your file has failed to process today. After content on the line 14842 another line of content is expected at line 14846, which is missing causing the file 'sta_prtfile_0332025' to fail. You can refer to the attached screenshot for the expected content.

Please revise and resubmit 'sta_prtfile_0332025' for further processing.

STA_PRTFILE_0332025, still needs to be looked at.. according to your screenshot, those two lines mentioned, 1492 and 1496 refers to the last statement in the file.. when I look at it on my side I can't see any differences in the file.. I'm hoping that you can make an exception for whatever caused this to fail, since it's at the very end of the file, and I have to assume that everything else up to that point processed.."

Hi Aleksandar @Billtrust<mailto:jobfail@billtrust.com>

I have two emails from you of File Failures. Did anything work and get Uploaded to Billtrust? I attached your other email here.

This failed: BILLTRUST_IFS_EINVOICE_20250312_133638000118.txt and you retagged under 30454107...but then THST failed...due to multiple duplicate files...

So what do we do here? Can Billtrust restage?

Please tell me which files are DUPLICATES, and please tell me which files are NEW/Can be UPLOADED by you to be Restaged.


Thank you,

Hi Chris, 

I apologize, but the system flagged all the files as duplicates when I attempted to reprocess them. It appears that this data has already been processed, so no further action is required at this time.

This seems weird to me..you are saying all the file failures were Dupps...and that they already were processed. Ok fine. But, I know IFS einvoices get sent to Billtrust daily from Ingram. So it feels like we could be missing some?

So can you confirm if Billtrust has 03/13/25 IFS EInvoices?

Good Morning Chris,

3/14 Files

The following files processed successfully under batch 30467217:
billtrust_ifs_einvoice_20250314_033721000498.pgp
billtrust_ifs_einvoice_20250314_073648000040.pgp
billtrust_ifs_einvoice_20250314_093700000984.pgp

3/13 Files

I believe this is where the confusion is occurring with this case. It appears duplicates were submitted while the case was being worked (for a separate duplicate file) which resulted in both batches being deleted.
I successfully reprocessed the following files under new batch 30468017:
BILLTRUST_IFS_EINVOICE_20250313_133648000596.PGP
BILLTRUST_IFS_EINVOICE_20250313_073658000215.PGP

Please let me know if there are any other files that may be in question.

Hi William,

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for clarifying things below! I see batch 30468017 with the Ifs invoices you reprocessed thank you!

Questions for you though, I also see another Batch # 30467975 (2025-03-17_06.47.46 - INGRAMMICROUS_INV) that was Uploaded 6 minutes before 30468017. This contains only 1 IFS invoice (Screenshot below).
              Was this another Batch you uploaded too? Please advise.

William,

Thanks for the reply about Case # 04040655 & Case # 04040705.

The INGRAMMICROCA Open Balance file didn't upload because of this file. The person internally at Ingram I reached out to about this is currently OOO.

How can we get that Open Balance file to upload? Can we remove these two batches and upload the Open Bal file?



Thank you,

Hello Gary, 

I do not see you listed as a file failure contact so I'm adding you to this case. It looks like our Client Services team informed you of the batch failures over the weekend. 
Hopefully I can provide some more detail.
All the files since 3/7 have failed on line 1. If we open the file in a text editor (Notepad++), there are random characters which would indicate the file has become corrupt.
See the attached screenshot showing the last successful file 'intertape_ipgusa_inv_030625a.txt' compared to failing file 'intertape_ecpcan_inv_030725a.txt'.
What I noticed is that the corrupt files are encoded in ANSI format while the successful files are encoded UTF-8. This is likely causing your issue due to 

UTF-8 using 8 bits per byte, while ANSI uses 7 bits per byte. 

Please revise these files to be encoded in UTF-8 and resubmit.

Good Morning,

BatchId: 30352239 was staled due to account 6914102 which is currently configured with ""Due Date"" as the autopay timing option. Since your data files are not configured with a ""Due Date"", this should be changed to ""Receipt"" which aligns with your processing.
For this batch, I manually pushed the processing through completion, but the account setup should be addressed to prevent delays in the future.

Good Morning,

We attempted to remove the corrupt PDF from 'ODFL_INV_20250313202006478478543871' but we have read-only permissions on the file. This is causing the following error when we attempt to remove '07125766258_DR_002.pdf'.

Regarding a corrupt PDF, that when we sent it to you was not corrupt, I can download it from our FTP site and it is viewable.

We have the following questions:


1. Did Billtrust receive the entire 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip file on Friday afternoon at approximately 2:45-3:00PM
* If yes, did you begin processing the file and is it the one that is related to Case # 04033416?
* Is there any part of the 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip file that has been completed and invoicing sent out?
2. We responded to the original Case # 04033416 asking BT to remove the bad file and continue processing. Why are we only being told there is an issue at 10:15 AM on Monday, when we repeatedly asked for updates over the weekend.
3. After Michael confirmed that the partial 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip was deleted on Friday, 03/14/2025 at 3:25 PM, We attempted to resend the 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip at 5:06 PM on 03/14/2025 it was not fully delivered until 7:37 PM on 03/15/2025 (1 day, 3hrs) after kicking off the job. Was this file handled?

We need to know what has been received by Billtrust and what you do not have.
Thanks,
Sheryl"

Did Billtrust receive the entire 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip file on Friday afternoon at approximately 2:45-3:00PM

- Yes, We receive the entire 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip file on Friday afternoon at 2:51 PM EST

* If yes, did you begin processing the file and is it the one that is related to Case # 04033416?

* Is there any part of the 6.22 GB ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip file that has been completed and invoicing sent out?

- 16.5 MB of the ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip file attempted to process but failed in GMC (SF Case 04033416). Nothing from this batch has processed

2. We responded to the original Case # 04033416 asking BT to remove the bad file and continue processing. Why are we only being told there is an issue at 10:15 AM on Monday, when we repeatedly asked for updates over the weekend.

- My shift ended at 6:30 pm EST on Friday, as soon as I started today at 9:30 am I was made aware of the escalation and started working on a resolution. 

3.

- The re-submitted 6.22 GB 'ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip' was received on the FTP at 7:37 pm EST on Friday 3-14-25. ODFL are set to process matching invoice and statement files together. In order for ODFL_INV_20250313191500104.zip to be picked up by GMC they will need to submit a STMT file with a matching date/time in the filename."

Good morning, Jim,

Thank you for writing back to us.

I wanted to inform you that we always receive three files for the processing of such job but in this case, we only received two files '2025_03_14_PACE_EPIC_000377.GPG' and '2025_03_14_pace_epic_000377'. However the third file which supposed to be a .txt file was missing and because of this the job failed to process.
Adding further to this, I saw that you resubmitted these files along with the require .txt file that got processed now. Please could you confirm on this as well?

Hello Chrissy, 

The lookup folder that was setup to hold the 'PRIDE_ExemptAccounts.csv' file was incorrect.
The file should be placed in ftp\PRIDEMOBILITY\Lookup. This particular folder is protected against cleanup scripts to prevent it from getting deleted. In the future, if you have to update the file, please drop it here: ftp\PRIDEMOBILITY\Lookup.

Have a great weekend!"

Hello,

I have uploaded this batch again this evening and it appears to have been successful. Can you please let me know if it has been received? I didn't change anything, the zip has the thinbilling file included same as always, so I'm not sure what the issue is.

Hi Team

Can someone help as I don’t understand the issue

From the message below you tell me there is no data file for the PDF 1150967443

And then there is no PDF for the data file 1150967443


This means to me that the PDF and Data files are in the zip file.

Hi Team


Thanks for the work being do on this issue.
However I need to get invoices to customers from this batch, so I am proposing to remove the invoice which is causing the problem and I will re send the file for uploading.
Please if you could continue to find the problem so we can avoid this going forward.

Once the issue is found PLEASE DO NOT upload the file as this will cause duplicate invoices on the customers accounts

Thanks

Plz regard my previous comments. 

There was an issue with the data file TH11509674430000231363_ZTF1.PDF. It had an uppercase "".PDF"" extension instead of a lowercase , so it wasn't being picked up. We have updated the workflow, and now GMC will recognize both uppercase and lowercase file extensions.

Hello Ken, 

BatchId: 30364613 is failing due to unexpected data in file 'rbscorp_stm_022825.edi'. There is an invalid transition of data from the CONS-STMT-DTL record on line 95937 to the what is expected on the next line (CONS-STMT-HDR_with_08-1).
Removing the last line in the file (line 95938) would allow the file to process.
Please revise and resubmit 'rbscorp_stm_022825.zip' for processing.

Our system is unable to read any valid statement records from the contents. They appear to be improperly formatted to contain a lot of unexpected inputs, possibly due to the fact that they were created from PDF (savetoXML). We are attaching two screenshots, one is of the most recently processed file from February which had no issues and one screenshot is of a file from today for comparison.

Please review and revise the files on your end so that they match the expected setup as we saw in the ""good_file"".

Thank you,"

As we further analyzed the file, we noticed that line 32143 should start with 0,1 instead of 0,0.
After every last line that contains Delivery fee, the next line should start with 0,1 but here its starting with 0,0 which looks like is the reason for the failure of this file.

Please, have a look and proceed further accordingly with this failure.

Good Morning, 

BatchId: 9735052 failed due to unexpected data in file 'csv-statement-03-24-2025.csv'.
There is an invalid sequence of data from the InvDtlLineDeliveryCharges record on line 32142 to the InvDtlLineCharges record on line 32143. See attached screenshot. Please revise and resubmit this file for processing.

Hello Team,

As per our CS team, there is a follow-up question: ""Can you clarify what exactly the invalid sequence is. When comparing 32141 with 32142, the data is exactly the same but only one row failed. The same for row 32143 & 32144. Please advise ASAP because we are unable to invoice to the customer.""

The indicator at the very beginning of the line dictates the record and how the parser handles it. The transition from line 32142 to 32143 is invalid.

On line 32142, you have a 0,2 record which cannot be followed by a 0,0 record on the next line according to the parser. Reviewing the full data on line 32143, it appears this is a new Statement/invoice and should contain a 1,0 record (InvSummNewDoc1).

I am looking at the file and this is a needle in the haystack for me.  do you have a row that it failed on?  Or set of characters that cause issues for you?  Without additional detail, I don’t think I will be able to find the offending data element.

Apologies for the delayed response, I was not available due to my week offs.

I could see that on 17/03/2025 we received 'rrts_edi20250317.zip' in 2 batches i.e. 30471957 and 30471503 out of which 30471503 failed because a CSV file was missing however 30471957 was successfully processed. 

On 20/03/2025 we received 'rrts_edi20250317.zip' under batch id 30495553 however the batch got failed as it was flagged as duplicate(SF Case# 04037367) previously processed under batch id 30471957.

Hello Kate, 

The issue is with the recently updated lookup file 'SchaedlerManagerlookup.csv'. It appears the format is causing the current failures. 
Either a new version of the file is needed OR if we can use the previous version of the lookup file, we can reprocess the files.

Hello Team,

File 'skechers_invcrd_C.can.CAN.2503031930.txt' failed due to unexpected encoding format.
The failed file only has Line Feed characters at the end of each line, and it needs to have Carriage Return and Line Feed characters.

Good Afternoon,

We have been unable to process todays file ""WATERBILL.RPT"" due to some unexpected spacing between invoices. There appears to be one additional blank line at the start of the file as well as between each invoice section. This is causing all subsequent data to be shifted out of place because it is one line further down than where it is expected. Screenshot is attached to help highlight the issue.

Please revise the file to remove the extra spacing that is found after each segment of data, then resubmit your file for processing.

Thank you,"

They send us an email every time they receive a file, if there are any issues, if they resolved the issue - usually an empty image file for reinvoices.
Screenprint below of what the list of emails look like.

Looking through today's emails, it looks like they received all of the invoice files but only 2 of the image files.

The matching invoice data and image files have to be received before they process the related invoices.

If filefetcher has any errors, it will hold the image files.  I see logs for 6 files - I don't know if anyone has worked them.
I'll see if I can get things going.

I pushed one of the six files through and received an email back from Billtrust that they had it.
So, did the same for the other five.

Other people on our team can check for this same error, so you should include Ken Guill on the email next time and mention that it could be a problem with sending the image files."

Hello Team,

We have run into multiple batches that have locked up during processing recently. Our application support team has found the data structure has the same content repeated over and over for each line item that displays on the document with just the transaction number and total amount changing for each line.

Good morning,

Batch id:

The following batch failed due to unexpected data.
As we checked, we noticed that the file 'EQUIPMENT CREDIT MEMOS 20250227 (NEW FORMAT).PDF.CSV' is wrongly formatted.
We compared the format of this file with the ones that got processed previous and found that the format is wrong.
I have attached the screenshot for the reference.
Please revise and resubmit above file along with corresponding pdf file for processing.
However, we have removed this file and resubmitted rest of the files for further processing under new batch 30382395

Hello Billtrust,

Was this error different from our usual shifted line errors that Lenora has been correcting and re-submitting? Do you have an ETA on resolution?

Lenora fixed and is submitting a new invoice file WC_AR_BILLTRUST_INVOICE_03182025_11_10_27.txt. I want to make sure that invoices aren’t sent twice if the original file WC_AR_BILLTRUST_INVOICE_03182025_01_10_27.txt is also being re-processed.

# **Case # 04040270 is closed**

Good Afternoon,

Unfortunately your Batch ID: 30524175 has failed to process today. This failure was caused by duplicate file 'WHOLESALE_STMT_20904_34787.0182_00107529.CSV', which was also included in Batch ID: 30524175. So we removed this file and restaged remaining valid file for processing under Batch ID: 30524227. If this was done in error, then no further action is required. If you wish to have us process a new file, please upload accordingly.

Ryan / Ceci,

It appears that multiple batches to BillTrust were initiated today, outside of the automated scheduled batch transmissions.

User AUSTINS kicked off two back Billtrust transmissions at 9:39am & 9:56am, see embedded pic:

 ![](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://netwes.zendesk.com/attachments/token/zzT8bHFRlbvUnJcmhjUxg8nkc/?name=image.png__;!!A1SZS2J3tng!zT-1Y1l8zM0vuxosBPv7k7qiylRurGC1fJWzISBCe7V35j2bmx81-EE80FiFO57BonOdvVb0Fepy7UA61Q$ )

If AUSTINS is also going to be sending these out, he needs to understand that doubling up transmissions like this can cause data loss and/or duplication.  This is why we changed how Cassie processes her non-standard transmissions over at branch 1.  He also needs to understand not to perform these functions around the 11:00am, 4:00pm, 6:00pm, & 6:15pm time slots, else he could potentially interfere with the automatic transmissions as well.

We will continue to monitor this case and will advise once it's resolved at BillTrust.

# **Case # 04040270 is closed**

Good Afternoon,

Unfortunately your Batch ID: 30524175 has failed to process today. This failure was caused by duplicate file 'WHOLESALE_STMT_20904_34787.0182_00107529.CSV', which was also included in Batch ID: 30524175. So we removed this file and restaged remaining valid file for processing under Batch ID: 30524227. If this was done in error, then no further action is required. If you wish to have us process a new file, please upload accordingly.

Regards,
 Julian Ullman
